# AI Powered Expense Tracker — Frontend

## My Motivation

Ever since I became a university student living thousands of miles away from my family, I’ve gained a much deeper understanding of the importance of money and how difficult it can be to manage it well. I’ve seen firsthand how having proper control over finances can significantly impact one’s quality of life. Growing up, I noticed a daily habit of my mum: she carefully logged every expense she made and tracked both income and spending. This was all done physically in a notebook. While it was effective, I also saw how vulnerable this approach was—easy to lose, hard to analyse, and limited to manual insights. As I started managing my own finances independently, I wanted a system that not only tracked expenses but also helped me understand my spending habits and improve them over time.

Hence, I decided to start this project to solve that need. It allows me to apply and strengthen my skills in full-stack development—especially Next.js, which I had recently learned and to dive deeper into building AI- and LLM-powered applications that solve real, personal problems.

In short, this project sits at the intersection of personal experience, practical problem-solving, and my long-term goal of building intelligent, impactful software.
